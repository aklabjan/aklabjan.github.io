                    <span class="text-primary">Problem</span>
                </h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5"> The problem we are trying to solve is to accurately label different herbs in a
                    herb garden when a photo is taken. Specifically, we aim to identify the herbs parsley, thyme,
                    chives, and oregano, while labeling all other herbs as unclassified herb. The goal of this project
                    is to develop a computer vision model that can recognize these specific herbs in an image with high
                    accuracy and efficiency.
                    <br><br>
                    It might be out of curiosity for someone to figure out what kind of herbs they have in their garden
                    or forest. Accurate classification of herb leaves is critical for quality control, authentication,
                    and conservation of medicinal plants. Therefore, the proposed project aims to develop a herb leaf
                    classification system that can identify individual plants within a garden and differentiate between
                    different herb species based on their leaf images.

                    Importance and Motivation
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">The problem we are trying to solve is important for several reasons. Firstly, it
                    can satisfy the curiosity of people who want to know what kind of herbs they have in their garden or
                    environment. This can be time-consuming and challenging for those without extensive herb knowledge.
                    Secondly, this tool can also be helpful for the food industry, as it can assist with quality control
                    in the production of herb-infused products and reduce the risk of misidentification, which can be
                    dangerous if a misidentified herb is consumed.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, accurate identification of herb leaves is crucial for quality control, authentication, and
                    conservation of medicinal plants. The development of a herb leaf classification system that can
                    identify different herb species based on their leaf images can aid in the production of medicines,
                    as well as the identification and preservation of endangered plant species. Additionally, the
                    accurate labeling of herbs in natural environments can provide valuable data for ecological studies,
                    aiding in the conservation and management of natural habitats. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a
                    computer vision model that can accurately and efficiently identify different herb species in images,
                    as it has practical applications for the food industry, herb enthusiasts, medicinal purposes, and
                    environmental research.

                <h2 class="mb-0">Current State Of The Art</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">In recent years, herb classification using leaf images has gained significant
                    attention due to its potential applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture, and food
                    industry. The ability to accurately identify different herb species can help in quality control of
                    herbal products, detection of adulteration, and conservation of rare and endangered plant species.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of the existing studies in this area have focused on the extraction of features from images
                    that represent a singular leaf from an herb and their classification using various machine learning
                    algorithms. Texture features, color histograms, and shape descriptors are some of the commonly used
                    features for herb classification[3]. However, with the recent advancements in deep
                    learning, several studies have started exploring the use of convolution neural networks (CNNs) for
                    herb recognition based on leaf images[1].
                    Leaf identification normally use images that taken in the laboratory with sophisticated equipment
                    and a white background. The accuracy of these models have been high.
                    <br><br>
                    Current research has shifted the focus from high-quality plant images to identifying leaves in
                    natural environments. Leaf segmentation in natural environments has different approaches and
                    accuracy levels. There have been many studies that aim to identify leaves based on images taken in
                    their natural environment[2]. These studies all focused on the identification of a
                    singular leaf taken in nature. The accuracy of the models was lower than the models discussed in the
                    prior paragraph that used images taken with sophisticated equipment and a white background, but the
                    models were still considered successful, with high accuracy.

                <h3 class="mb-0">Dataset</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-5">For this project, we were unable to find an already existing dataset. Therefore, we
                    will be creating our own dataset for the training & testing of model from Google Images. To create
                    the training & testing set we will pull 500-1000 images from Google Images for each of our four
                    herb types: parsley, thyme, chives, and oregano, and split the set into 90% and 10% to train &
                    test.
                    <br><br>
                    For the final test set we will be pulling 20-30 images of herb gardens. We will manually label these
                    images to test the prediction of our trained model in presence of multiple herbs in a single image.
                    Our main goal is to segment these herb garden images to segment into different herb-leaves region
                    and then predict their type in the image and label them.
